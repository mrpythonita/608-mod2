# Project: 608-mod2
NMSU Graduate Course Work
-------------------------
## Introduction 
The scope of this project is to use both Python native programming functionalities, and the statistics module to calucalate count, sum, mean, median, and mode. Both approaches are expected to return the same results.

## Getting Started

There is one data-set avalilabe for this project and it is a list of 1000 numbers created with list comprehension.

## Prerequisites

Python 3 is the environment utilized with the addition of the following libraries:

* __statistics__ (+ dependencies) 

## Installing

```
import statistics
data = [i for i in rnage(1,2000)]

```

## Deployment

* **central-native.py**: python file for creating/testing the core logic implemented in this project.
* **central-with-statistics.py**: python for creating/testing the core logic implemented in this project.
